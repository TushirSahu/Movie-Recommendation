## Methods Used:
For converting the description I used the Word Embeddings or Word vectorizationvectorization with help of ConterVectorizer of sklearn.Used the cosine similarity for getting the relationship between movies based on the description of the movies.Then apllied the streamlit for deploying it on webpage.
## Poster Fetching:
I used API of TMDB site for the poster fetching and then used the streamlit python library for the interface design.I tried some css with streamlit library but didn't go so well.I hope so improving the interface in the near future.
